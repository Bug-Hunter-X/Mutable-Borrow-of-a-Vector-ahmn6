This repository contains a simple example of a common error in Rust when dealing with mutable borrows of vectors.  The `bug.rs` file demonstrates the problem, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of understanding Rust's ownership and borrowing system to avoid data races and unexpected behavior. The core issue is that after taking a reference to an element in the vector (`&vec[0]`), the vector's capacity may change, potentially leading to the reference pointing to invalid memory.
